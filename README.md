 Objective:   Create a CLI-based CRUD system for managing student records.

The program runs in the command line and allows users to: Add a student ID, Name, Marks

View all student records , Update a student’s details , Delete a student’s record

During building this project, I explored some basic Java concepts like classes, objects, arrays, and how to use ArrayList.
